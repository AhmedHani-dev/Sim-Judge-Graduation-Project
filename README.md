# Sim-Judge-Graduation-Project
**(Under Construction)**

A Problem Solving Platform (Online Judge) that gives users ability to solve problems from multiple popular sources (ex: Codeforces, HackerRank),
Participate in Contests and compete with other users.

We're writing our own problems too and creating a Validation System that checks user submissions.


**Technologies currently being used:**
 - MVC ASP.NET for website development.
 - Python for web scraping and webcrawling and indexing of pages.
 - Flask Api to communicate between the scripts written in python and our website (Send back data and submit requests).
 - Docker for deployment and running user code in a sandbox.
